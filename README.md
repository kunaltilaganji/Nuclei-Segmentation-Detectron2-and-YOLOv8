**Summary of the dataset:** <p>
The NuInsSeg dataset contains more than *30k manually segmented nuclei from 31 human and mouse organs and 665 image patches extracted from H&E-stained whole slide images*. We also provide ambiguous area masks for the entire dataset to show in which areas manual semantic/instance segmentation were impossible.

**Human organs:**

cerebellum, cerebrum (brain), colon (rectum), epiglottis, jejunum, kidney, liver, lung, melanoma, muscle, oesophagus, palatine tonsil, pancreas, peritoneum, placenta, salivary gland, spleen, stomach (cardia), stomach (pylorus), testis, tongue, umbilical cord, and urinary bladder
